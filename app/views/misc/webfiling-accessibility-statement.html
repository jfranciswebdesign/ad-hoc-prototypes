      <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement procedure</h2>

      <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we
        respond to your complaint,

      <h2 id="technical-information">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>

      <p>Companies House is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

      <p>This service is partially compliant with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>
        AA standard. The non-compliances are listed in the next section.</p>

      <h2 id="non-accessible">Non-accessible content</h2>

      <p>The following content is non-accessible for the following reasons:</p>

      <h3>PDFs and other documents</h3>
      <p>Most PDF documents are not accessible in a number of ways including missing text alternatives and missing document structure (not mentioned by DAC, but still a known issue). This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value). We
        are investigating a solution to this problem and will update this statement in due course.</p>
      <h3>Tables</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the content is in incorrectly coded tables which may cause problems for users of assistive technology. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.
      </p>
      <h3>Timeout</h3>
      <p>The service times out without warning users or giving users the opportunity to extend. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.1 (Timing adjustable). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>

      <h3>Skip to content link</h3>
      <p>There is no skip to content link present. Users who cannot use a mouse will have to tab through the navigation links on each page. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (Bypass blocks). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
      <h3>Expandable content</h3>
      <p>There is expandable content which does not announce its state correctly, which may cause problems for users of assistive technology. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (Bypass blocks). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
      <h3>Focus order</h3>
      <p>There are elements which are not visible on screen which are focusable. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus order). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>When the page loads, focus is set to the first input field using JavaScript. This will create issues for screen reader users. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus order). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
      <h3>Non-descriptive links</h3>
      <p>There are links which have duplicated text which may cause problems for users of assistive technology. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (Link purpose – in context). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
      <h3>Tab panel</h3>
      <p>Some tabbed elements do not announce their state correctly to screen readers. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (Link purpose – in context). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
      Language</h3>
    <p>Page language has not been set in a small number of areas. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.1.1 (Language of page). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
    <h3>Grouped inputs</h3>
    <p>Some radio buttons are not grouped correctly on a small number of forms. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
    <h3>Colour contrast</h3>
    <p>There are text elements which fail to meet the minimum required colour contrast ratio. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast (Minimum)). We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
    <h3>Duplicated Heading Text</h3>
    <p>The heading and legend are repeated on one form. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and labels. We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.</p>
